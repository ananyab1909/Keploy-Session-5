task: Generate unit tests for Drogon C++ REST API endpoints
description: |
  - The codebase is a REST API built using Drogon framework in C++.
  - Each endpoint is implemented in a controller file and is protected using JWT auth.
  - Write unit tests using Google Test for controller logic, especially public route handlers.
  - Use TEST(SuiteName, TestName) with EXPECT_EQ, EXPECT_TRUE, etc.
  - Focus on request handling, parameter validation, and service responses.
  - Include <gtest/gtest.h> and relevant Drogon/controller headers.
  - Test scenarios: success, failure (e.g., 404, 401), and edge cases.
  - Output must be a valid .cpp file for each tested controller with Google Test cases.
