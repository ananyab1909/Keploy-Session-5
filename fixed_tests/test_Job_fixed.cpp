The build logs show a fatal error message when attempting to run the `testPersonValidator` function. The error states that `cpp_projects/third_party/libbcrypt/include/bcrypt/BCrypt.hpp` and `DepartmentsController.h` are missing from the `.gitattributes` file, which is used by the `make` command to add build dependencies to your Git repository.

The `testPersonValidator` function was not executed on this machine because it relies on certain libraries that were not available at the time of writing. In this case, it will likely fail due to missing files in `.gitattributes`. The error message provides context for how the build system failed to run the function properly.

It is recommended to run these tests separately and use appropriate Git attributes or commit messages to avoid conflicts with other code that may be running on your machine or other machines.
