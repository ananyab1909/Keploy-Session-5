It seems like the build logs you provided are incomplete. In order to fix the build errors, I would need to see your actual test file and code coverage report to understand what went wrong and how to correct it. Here's a summary of the error messages:
- `test_file` failed to compile.
- The build logs don't provide enough information to determine the exact cause of the compilation failure.

To fix this, you should follow these steps:

  1. **Review Build Logs**: Look at the build logs that contain the following lines: `{BUILD_LOG_CONTENT}` and `{TEST_FILE_CONTENT}`. These lines might provide clues about where things went wrong or what needs to be fixed.
  
  2. **Identify Semantic Errors**: Identify any syntax errors or semantic issues in your code, especially if there are any unexpected changes to the test case, as well as any other logical errors that you haven't been able to identify with the information provided in the build logs.

By identifying these areas, it will help you provide the most comprehensive fix possible. 

If you need more specific advice or have a complete codebase before this issue arises again, please share your entire project and test files so far, along with the actual error messages from the build logs. Without this information, the process can't be accurately adjusted or fixed.
