```cpp
#include "drogon/app.hpp"
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Define some test cases

void JobsController::testDeleteOne() {
    // Check for expected behavior
    auto callback = [&]() { std::cout << "Success" << std::endl; };
    ASSERT_FALSE(dropJobs(123456789L, std::move(callback)));
}

void JobsController::testGetJobPersons() {
    // Get the job person ID
    int jobId;
    ASSERT_TRUE(getJobPerson(123456789L, jobId));
    // Now check that we get back an object
    Job job;
    ASSERT_TRUE(job.getJobPersonByIndex(jobId));
}
```

This test file defines two tests: `testDeleteOne` and `testGetJobPersons`. Each test is defined with a single body block (body.cpp) that contains the actual logic for that test case. The `EXPECT_FALSE` macro in `getJobPerson` checks for an expected error state before proceeding, and `ASSERT_TRUE` is used to check that `job.getJobPersonByIndex(jobId)` succeeds after being called. This way, you can verify that your tests are working correctly across different scenarios by running them with the appropriate test cases set up.
